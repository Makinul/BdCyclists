This is an Android application developed using Jetpack Compose, aiming to replicate the core UI and navigation patterns of a fitness tracking app like Strava. The project focuses on modern Android development practices, including declarative UI, robust navigation, and dependency injection.

## Features

* **Core UI Structure:**
    * Dynamic Top App Bar with a title and action icons (User Profile, Search, Settings).
    * Conditional Back Button in the Top App Bar based on navigation state.
    * Five-item Bottom Navigation Bar with custom icons and selected state highlighting.
    * Two-tab layout positioned below the Top App Bar (e.g., for "Progress" and "Activities").

* **Navigation:**
    * Implemented screen navigation using Jetpack Compose Navigation.
    * Smooth **left-to-right and right-to-left slide animations** for screen transitions.
    * Navigation triggered by clicks on both Bottom Navigation Bar items and Top App Bar action icons.

* **Dependency Injection:**
    * Integrated **Koin** for managing and injecting dependencies throughout the application.
    * Setup Koin modules for ViewModels, Repositories, and network services.

* **Networking:**
    * Configured **Ktor Client** for performing network calls.
    * Utilizes Kotlinx Serialization for efficient JSON data handling.

* **Styling & Theming:**
    * Customized Top App Bar color and Status Bar color to align with the application's theme.
    * Configured distinct icon colors for selected and unselected states in the Bottom Navigation Bar.
    * Dedicated background color for the Profile screen.
    * Basic Search Bar implemented within the Search screen.
